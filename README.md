# Tip Calc
Apple watch sample app to figure the amount to leave at a restaurant for a tip

Another simple app that is helping me learn Swift and the Apple Watch platform. This app is functional, not sure how readable the code is.

# Improvements to make
<ul>
	<li>Properly comment code</li>
	<li>Figure out proper way to display two decimal places and remove embarrassing hack</li>
	<li>Add slider to set tip percentage from 10% - 30%</li>
</ul>
